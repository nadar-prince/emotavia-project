    <!-- FOUNDER STORY -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Founder Story</h2>

        <p class="section-text">
            Project Emotavia was born from an invisible struggle — a struggle that many face but few talk about.
            This idea emerged during a period of deep emotional and neurological disruption, where communication felt impossible,
            clarity disappeared, and the world suddenly became difficult to understand. After a neurological attack, even simple
            emotions felt complex, even simple conversations felt heavy, and for months, expressing feelings was a challenge.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            During that silent phase, one truth became painfully clear: India has no structured, stigma-free space where people
            can safely express their emotions without judgment, misunderstanding, or fear. The founder experienced what millions
            experience daily — being misunderstood, being unable to articulate inner chaos, and having no quick, reliable
            emotional support system.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            Project Emotavia was not created from theory. It was created from recovery, from resilience, and from the realization
            that emotional challenges do not discriminate — any student, any adult, any person can struggle silently.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            Project Emotavia stands as a reminder: emotional wellbeing is not a luxury. It is a necessity. And everyone deserves
            a safe space to feel, to speak, and to be understood.

    <!-- PURPOSE -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Purpose</h2>

        <ul class="purpose-list">
            <li>Because emotional pain is silent.</li>
            <li>Because people break quietly before they ask for help.</li>
            <li>Because being understood should not depend on luck.</li>
            <li>Because not everyone can reach a therapist instantly.</li>
            <li>Because sometimes you just need a human who listens without judgment.</li>
        </ul>

            Project Emotavia exists to give every individual a safe moment, a real connection, and a path toward

        <h2>Why Your Support Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Project Emotavia was built to provide a safe, stigma-free emotional wellbeing ecosystem for India.
            Every contribution big or small helps us reach more people who are silently struggling.
            Your support enables us to expand our AI-driven emotional tools, train peer supporters, build community networks,
            and ensure that emotional help remains accessible to everyone, anytime.
